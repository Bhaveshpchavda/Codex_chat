# Water Jug Problem (4-gallon & 3-gallon)

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic water jug
problem: using a 4-gallon jug and a 3-gallon jug to measure exactly 2 gallons
in the 4-gallon jug.

## Usage

```bash
python water_jug.py
```

The script prints the sequence of actions and the jug states that result in
2 gallons in the 4-gallon jug.
